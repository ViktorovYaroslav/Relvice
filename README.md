One of my favorite pages, because on this example i made better my skills of adaptive layout. Burger menu leaves much to be desiredðŸ˜Š

Technologies:
- HTML5;
- SVG;
- CSS3:
  - Flex-box;
  - negative margins with positive paddings(most used in this template with Flex-box for creation free places between flex-elements, today more modern way is the gap for Flex-box, but solution with margin & padding more friendly for browsers - only my opinionðŸ™‚);
  - Media queries.
